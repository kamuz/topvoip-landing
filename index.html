            <h3>Get Your Team (and Customers) on the Same Page With Unified Communications</h3>
            <p>Gone are the days of providing customer support only through a dedicated landline phone. Today’s customers want help from their platform of choice. From text messaging to video conferencing, managing different channels is challenging. Unified communications systems put all your communication and collaboration networks in one spot.</p>
            <h3>Boost Productivity With VoIP Text Messaging Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Texting is the main form of communication for both team members and clients. But, not all VoIP phone systems offer SMS for businesses. Others may only provide it for administrators. Adding support options, like texting, shows customers that your company values their time.</p>
            <h3>Mobile Apps for Working From Anywhere</h3>
            <p>To please both customers and employees, more business leaders look for mobile smartphone solutions. Doing so allows team members to answer and respond to incoming messages regardless of location. While mobile apps are ideal for your sales team, remote workers also benefit. Regardless of which members of your team are utilizing mobile apps, sky-high calling rates for long-distance phone calls are no longer a concern. Your remote employees will need to ditch the home phone in favor of a smartphone to utilize this feature. But with that upgrade, they'll be dialing in from anywhere in no time.</p>
            <h3>Save Time With the Voicemail-to-Email Voice Over IP Feature</h3>
            <p>One purpose of investing in cheap VoIP services is to increase productivity. But, you lose efficiency if your support team needs to listen and press buttons to get voicemails. Instead, the voicemail-to-email feature delivers data to your team on their chosen device.</p>
            <h3>Improve Customer Response Times Using Call Waiting and Routing</h3>
            <p>Customers are more impatient than ever. Switching to a cheap VoIP phone system doesn’t mean giving up essential capabilities like call queuing and routing. VoIP provides affordable options to lower response times. Easily add hold music to keep callers who do have to wait on the line, and route incoming calls where they need to go faster.</p>
            <h3>Enhance Communications With Voice Over Internet Protocol Team Chat Rooms</h3>
            <p>Workforce collaboration with teams across the globe can get tricky. With team chat rooms, a feature provided by some cheap VoIP providers and PBX systems, your staff can talk in real-time. Instead of transferring customers, this feature connects your team to solutions. With just an internet connection and a laptop, desktop, or even a cell phone, your team can connect with one another from anywhere with ease.</p>
            <h3>Develop Better Customer and Team Relationships With Video Conferencing</h3>
            <p>Just because we live in a digital world doesn’t mean that our clients and staff don’t want to see a human behind the screen. With video conferencing, you can get the best of both worlds. Your team and customers can talk from any device, from any place around the globe. This hands-on communication of a business phone system equipped with VoIP helps your organization collaborate and establish trust.</p>
            <h3>Make Data-Driven Decisions Based on Advanced Analytics</h3>
            <p>Access to high-quality data is critical to improving business operations. Inexpensive VoIP services provide information about every call, caller, and agent. Select providers help you narrow reporting data by dates and team members.</p>
            <h3>Rely on Your VoIP for Call Monitoring and Recording</h3>
            <p>Business owners can monitor and record phone calls from any device and location, with just a simple WiFi connection. Plus,  cloud-based services store data, so you don't have to worry about backing up critical information. Team leaders use this data to ensure every customer receives the best service.</p>

                    <p>Shifting your organization to the cloud is easier than ever before. Yet, with so many options to choose from, it can feel overwhelming. Before making a move, it’s important to research each company. Aside from finding the cheapest VoIP, you should also ask about the provider’s hidden fees, support options, and much more.</p>
                    <p>Although many cheap Voice over IP providers offer similar features, you may find that not all your current equipment, like fax machines, are supported. Plus, when you need extra help, it’s crucial to be able to contact and speak to a real person immediately.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Learn About the Set-Up Process and Fees</h3>
                <p>Switching to a cheap Voice over Internet Protocol system shouldn’t require a hands-on IT department. Nor should your company get hit with unexpected costs. Before choosing your cloud service, talk to your provider. Find out if you’ll pay extra for setup, activation, porting, or equipment. Then, review the installation process. Make sure you can set up your VoIP service in-house or that you have access to extra support.</p>
                <h3>Inspect the VoIP Quality and Reliability</h3>
                <p>Communicating with your staff and clients is essential to businesses. Yet, dropped calls and poor call quality reflect poorly on your company. Your VoIP service may affect your reputation. Talk to your VoIP service provider about connectivity in your area. Ask for local testimonials. Then, look for customer reviews that hint at connectivity issues.</p>
                <h3>Ensure Customer Support Services Provide Real-Time Assistance</h3>
                <p>From team training to unexpected problems, VoIP customer support is critical. Yet, not all companies offer 24/7 support. Before picking a cheap Voice over IP provider, examine their support options. While an online help desk is great, having access to training materials and webinars help your team fix minor issues without waiting on hold for a customer service response.</p>
                <h3>Double-Check Support Levels for Your Current Equipment</h3>
                <img src="img/icon-android-ios.png" alt="android-ios" class="uk-float-right">
                <p>Ask your provider if you can use your existing phones and fax machines. Some companies offer ATA gateways and help with installation. Also, check if their mobile options cover both iOS and Android phones.</p>
                <h3>Discover New Equipment Purchase or Lease Options</h3>
                <p>If you want to upgrade your equipment, then some VoIP providers sell or lease equipment. Others provide a free softphone or office phone with a contract. Ask about equipment options and pricing plans before choosing your Voice over IP service.</p>
                <h3>Determine Package and Feature Availability</h3>
                <p>Although you may not currently need video conferencing tools, as your company grows, then you’ll want more options. Avoid the hassle of switching to a new company every time you experience growth. Instead, ensure that your VoIP provider offers free upgrades.</p>
                <h3>Protect Your Business With Disaster Recovery Plans</h3>

            <p class="green-text">Once you’ve made your list of cheap VoIP providers, then it’s time to get to work. After all, you don’t want to sign up with the most inexpensive Voice over IP service on your list just to lower your current phone bill without doing some further research. Instead, review the features and pricing structures, and contact each company. Gather enough information to narrow your list down to your top three to five choices. Then, talk to representatives from each company about a free trial or demo.</p>
            <h3>Make a Data-Driven Decision</h3>
            <p>Although all the signs may point to your need for cheap VoIP service, it’s essential to dive into your budget and strategy to ensure that you’re going with the best plan. While unlimited Voice over Internet Protocol calls may save your business money, will the costs of switching outweigh the benefits?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pull up information about call volume, year-over-year data, and projections.</li>
                <li>Determine the necessary features and added costs.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate how VoIP aligns with your company's goals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By reviewing your internal data before choosing a provider, you’ll have the facts to understand what you need in a VoIP plan. Plus, it'll be easier to get everyone on board when you can show how VoIP fits into your overall objectives.</p>
            <h3>Review Contract Information Including Extra Fees</h3>
            <p>Each VoIP provider uses a different pricing structure. Some require annual payments, while others use a pay-as-you-go plan. Choose services that lower your telecom costs now and in the future. Make a list for each provider that lays out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One-time fees for installation, number porting, and other hidden costs.</li>
                <li>Ongoing upcharges for international calling or text messages.</li>
                <li>Standard costs for upgraded equipment, features, or support options.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have questions about contract wording, then ask for clarification before making a final decision. Above all, consider how your costs will change as your organization grows and scales.</p>
            <h3>Get the Most From Your Free Demo or Trial</h3>
            <p>Whether its 14-days or 30-days, use your free trial or demo to discover how each cheap VoIP service functions. Enlist help from team members so that people from all departments can test it out. Plus, access each company's customer support options.</p>
            <div class="lignt-blue-bg">
                <p><strong>Essential elements to consider are:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How does the mobile app function on iOS and Android phones?</li>
                    <li>Is the call quality top-notch, or do you notice connectivity issues?</li>
                    <li>Can your staff adjust to the interface, or will more training be required?</li>
                    <li>Were you able to locate documentation online or get assistance after hours?</li>
                    <li>Did the service give all the features necessary for excellent customer service?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>About a week before your trial period is up, send out a short survey to your staff. Ask questions from above, along with providing space for them to elaborate. It's crucial to understand why something didn't work for them. You may also consider sending a survey to affected customers to get their input as well.</p>
            <p>Once you've compiled the information, then hold a meeting with management. Discuss the survey results and address any questions. By getting everyone on board before switching to a cheap VoIP provider, you'll have better support once you make the final decision.</p>
